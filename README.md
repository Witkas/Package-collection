# Package Collection and Delivery
In this simulation a robot needs to collect and deliver packages between various locations in a village. <br>
There are 4 different robot algorithms, with different efficiency. All of them are commented in the code. <br>
We run a simulation using a `runRobot()` function or compare two different robots using `compareRobots()`.
